                    As a registered association in Spain, Nobodies Collective has legal obligations.
                    Before anyone can access shared resources, we need to confirm agreement to our
                    policies. This system handles that simply and keeps everything current.

                            To access association resources, everyone needs to agree to our policies:
                            GDPR data handling, privacy policy, consent terms, and Creative Commons
                            licensing. This is a one-time process (unless documents are updated).

                            Once you've completed your profile and consents, you'll have access to

                            tools. Teams can be configured for different working groups.

                            Legal documents evolve. When policies change in meaningful ways, you'll
                            be asked to review and re-consent. This ensures everyone is working
                            under the same current agreements.

                            Our by-laws require a roll of voting members for governance (general
                            assemblies, elections, etc.). If you'd like to participate in governance,
                            you can apply to become a voting member. This is entirely optional.

                    That's it! Once your consents are in place, you'll have access to association resources.
                    If you're interested in participating in governance as a voting member, you can
                    optionally submit an application from your dashboard.
